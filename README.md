# Double Pendulum Mechanics with Animation using Python

This project is a simulation of the mechanics of a double pendulum using Python. The double pendulum consists of two masses connected by two rods and is a classic example of a chaotic system. The animation shows the motion of the pendulum over time, and the user can adjust the initial conditions to explore the behavior of the system.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the simulation, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Matplotlib

### Installing

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/abhiseksarkar2001/Double-Pendulum-mechanics-with-animation-using-python.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Double-Pendulum-mechanics-with-animation-using-python


3. Open the Jupyter Notebook file:

jupyter-notebook Double\ Pendulum\ mechanics\ with\ animation\ using\ python.ipynb


4. Run the simulation by executing the cells in the notebook.
